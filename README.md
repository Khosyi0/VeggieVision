VeggieVision: Identifying Unfresh Vegetables and Fruits to Reduce Food Waste

# Summary
Fresh fruit and vegetables are rich in vitamins, minerals, and fiber, which are very good for the human body. Identification of fresh fruit and vegetables is very important in the agricultural industry. This can ensure that consumers will get vegetables and fruit that taste good and are rich in nutrition, ensuring that the agricultural industry provides quality products and increasing sales and market share.

Identification of fresh fruit and vegetables is usually done by humans. Identification carried out by humans has several disadvantages, namely that humans will become tired after carrying out the same task many times. This will affect their subjective level and accuracy in identifying fresh fruit and vegetables. And humans will find it difficult to meet the need for large-scale, high-efficiency, fast identifiers that require large costs.

Therefore, we aim to create a VeggieVision application to identify fresh or rotten fruit and vegetables in real time. This will help advance the agricultural industry, assist consumers in determining the fruit and vegetables they will buy or consume, and help entrepreneurs identify the fruit and vegetables they will sell.

# Background
Our journey to developing VeggieVision began with in-depth research into global food waste, focusing on fruits and vegetables. Having acknowledged the enormous scale of waste, we brainstormed solutions and found that technology, more so image recognition, is the best avenue forward. Besides helping in the reduction of household food waste, our solution will conserve resources and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. VeggieVision is a commitment to innovation and sustainability toward addressing pressing food waste issues.
